# top

The **`top`** (**t**able **o**f **p**rocesses) command shows a dynamic, real-time view of running processes and **kernel**-managed tasks in Linux. The command also provides a system information summary that shows resource utilization, including **CPU** and **memory usage**.

The **`top`** command has the following basic syntax:

```
top [options]
```

Run **`top`** without any options to display a live view of all processes running on the system:

```
top
```
